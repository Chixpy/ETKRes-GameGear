Nazo Puyo 2 continues where the original left off. We have here 200 new puzzles to solve, compared to the 100 of the predecessor. Each puzzle is played Puyo Puyo-style, but with a certain goal to complete using a preset set of puyos, e.g. 
destroy
all
puyos"
eliminate 9 puyos at once
make a triple combo
and
so
on
thereby
taxing
your
Puyo
Puyo
skills
and
strategies."

Another new addition is a battery backup, allowing you not only to save your current position, but also to save all puzzles you may create in the edit mode.
