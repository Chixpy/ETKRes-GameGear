Last
Bible
Special"
is
a
part
of
Last
Bible
series
which
are
a
sub-series
within
the
Megaten
universe.
The
events
of
Last Bible Special
take
place
in
an
alternate
Middle
East
in
the
beginning
of
the
Christian
era.
You
play
as
Materu
a
young
warrior
who
gets
an
assignment
from
the
bishop
of
Jerusalem
to
travel
to
four
dungeons.
The
demon
king
Graias
is
controlling
other
demons
who
found
their
hideout
in
those
dungeons
and
it's
your
task
to
defeat
them."

Unlike the three previous Last Bible games, 
Last
Bible
Special"
features
3D
first-person
dungeons
like
in
mainstream
Shin
Megami
Tensei
games.
The
game
is
heavier
on
dungeon
crawling:
you
cannot
travel
on
the
world
map
but
are
taken
automatically
to
the
huge
dungeons
which
you
should
complete
in
a
specific
order.
In
the
town
you
can
buy
items
as
well
as
recruit
party
members.
The
battles
are
random
and
turn-based.
Like
in
all
Megaten
games
you
can
communicate
with
the
demons
you
encounter
and
convince
them
to
join
your
party."
